Python has an incredible ecosystem of powerful analytics tools:
[NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/),
[Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/),
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
[Dask](https://dask.org/),
[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/),
[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/),
and more.

With a wide array of widgets, plot tools, and UI events that can trigger real Python callbacks, the Bokeh server is the bridge that lets you connect these tools to rich, interactive visualizations in the browser.
