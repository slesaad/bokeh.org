description: Better Theming Support
---
Bokeh currently has some minimal theming ability, that can specify properties for types.
It would be useful to have more targets and sophisticated ways to theme individual objects, or collections of objects.
Additionally some work is needed to improve or create visual assets that work with different themes, and to make DOM elements easily themeable as well.
