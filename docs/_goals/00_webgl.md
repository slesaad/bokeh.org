description: Use WebGL Consistently
---
Bokeh currently can use WebGL to accelerate plotting for larger datasets in some limited situations.
In addition to not fully supporting some use-cases, the internal cost is having to maintain two separate code paths.
It would be desirable to convert Bokehâ€™s rendering to always use WebGL whenever possible, so that better performance for larger data sets is always available, and to streamline maintenance for the future.
